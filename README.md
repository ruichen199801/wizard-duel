## Notes

1. The game is **web only** and not mobile-responsive. Please use **Chrome** for the best experience, as other browsers might have issues with audio playback that can prevent the game from running.
2. Vercel's cold start can cause initial delays or unexpected bugs that are not reproducible locally. If you experience this, just wait a few seconds and reload the page, the issue should typically resolve itself.
